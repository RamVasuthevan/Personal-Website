I don't know where Chez Ram is going but I'll start here:

Taco Seasoned Ground Turkey Double Stacker Hamburger with Cheese, Jalapenos Peppers and Bacon Strips on Brioche Buns

Each patty should be 1/4 kg

Instructions:
   1. Melt a 1/2 tablespoon on butter by setting Stove to 3
   2. Mix ground turkey and taco seasoning on cutting board. (Don't mix in the pan becuase you need to create a paty)
   3. Smash patty and 4 mintues on setting 5. Make sure give a good smash
   4. 4 mintues on the other side. Add jaoplees at 3:30. Turn off and then add cheese
   5. Spread butter on buns (How??)
   6. Toast buns on stove on 2 min on setting 3 (This does not toast them)

   can cook 3 patties on the large pan


Bacon:
   - from Cold pan, 5 mins at seting 5

Toast Buns
   - Toast buns on bacon grease
   - set to 3 for 2 mins
   - Can't toast fully on the small pan. Only the edges
