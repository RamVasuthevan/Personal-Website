I don't know where Chez Ram is going but I'll start here:

Taco Seasoned Ground Turkey Double Stacker Hamburger with Cheese, Jalapenos Peppers and Bacon Strips on Brioche Buns

Each patty should be 1/4 kg

Instructions:
   1. Melt a XX on butter by setting Stove to 3
   2. Mix ground turkey and taco seasoning on cutting board. (Don't mix in the pan becuase you need to create a paty)
   3. Smash patty and 4 mintues on setting 5. Make sure give a good smash
   4. 4 mintues on the other side. Add jaoplees at 3:30. Turn off and then add cheese
   5. Spread butter on buns (How??)
   6. Toast buns on stove on 2 min on setting 3 (This does not toast them)
