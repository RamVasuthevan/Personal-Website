I just started using Felt. The best way to descibe it is it feels like magic.

I been thinking about side projects using geospatial data or creating maps for a while, but I've been procrastinating on learning Mapbox. And way too much time trying to install SpatiaLite to a Windows Laptop.

No coding involved, I just dragged the two Shapefiles from Toronto Open Data Portal on and the map appeared. I then added the Felt's preexisting building footprint layer. It was then easy to quickly add coloring by category. And even better, (unlike some other tools) there is a working search bar, so you can look up parcels at an address. 

In general, I like open tools, so that I can more control over the output and be confident that publisher won't stop supporting the tool in a couple of years. But I value feature velocity more than everything else. (If you're reading this 10 years from now, you'll now how it worked out)

It didn't take me that look to set it up and start to see intresting things, near the water, on Algonquin Island, near my home.

Although, I need to work my styling.
