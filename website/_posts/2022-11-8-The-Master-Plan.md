(Quick taking of notes about the play)

H/T to [Ramsey Kilani](https://x.com/Ramsey_Kilani/status/1708619001675284924?s=20) for mentioning the play on Twitter. This play was written for me.

This play chronicles Sidewalk Labs' failed attempt to redevelop Queens Quay. I watched the play before I read the book. But even without reading the book, I knew that this would be a difficult topic to cover in a play. They did an amazing job!

 It was exciting, intriguing and educational throughout. The story was mainly told through a series of meetings, with brief interludes into  Toronto politics, government, the structure of Waterfront Toronto, etc.

Including a hilarious description of how in Toronto, a permit to cut down one tree can be appealed to entire city council. In this sense, city hall as a collective voted to deny a house owner the right to cut down a tree on their property; they said the tree was diseased, and city staff thought the homeowner wanted to put in a hot tub.

I thought the play was pretty fair to all parties, more of a tragedy without villains. The main antagonist, Dan Doctoroff, is portrayed not as evil but as an outsider American coming into Toronto who didn't understand Toronto politics or the dynamics of the city, trying to do something great. Another character played by XXX was more of an idealist.

Overall, the goals of the sidewalk project were seen as good, ambiguous, admirable and necessary but also a bit fantastical. The play did criticize Dan Doctoroff's upzoning in NYC for creating "gentrification," but the play as a whole was very anti-nimby

I look forward to reading the book.
