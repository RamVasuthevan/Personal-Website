The last 12 weeks have been great. Helped me figure out what to do with my life.

But my sabbatical is constrained by money and and thus constrained by time. It's time for focus.

Projects which will be focusing on:

1. Lobbying in Toronto
    - Build a great way to search and visualize data published by the City of Toronto's Lobbyist Registrar
2. TRREB MLS Search Engine
    - Build a [Virtual Office Website
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Office_Website) for TRREB's MLS to make it easier for Realtor and their clients to search for propery in Toronto
3. Open Map of Toronto 
    - Combine open data sources to create a better view of Toronto. Definitely [Property Boundaries](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/property-boundaries/) and [Address Points (Municipal) - Toronto One Address Repository
](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/address-points-municipal-toronto-one-address-repository/), and some more data sources from City of Toronto Open Data Portal and other data sources
4. Bits, Bips and Bricks
    - Write more regularly and about more topics 

It is now time to impose a totalitarian discipline on myself.

My cousin said after he started waking up at 5 a.m., he felt that he had an extra day. I will be waking up at (5 or 6) am. 
Refocus on "I want to add a bit more direction to my life"

Naval said that at a certain point, you stop intuitively understanding math and just memorize formulas. For me, I think that was grade 11. I used to love math, and I'm interested in understanding financial math, statistics and game theory. I want to relearn and intuitively understand math from foundation up. When I have though doing this in past I've gone too far too fast. (I common failire mode for me is spending to much time day dreaming what I going to do before taking the first step)
