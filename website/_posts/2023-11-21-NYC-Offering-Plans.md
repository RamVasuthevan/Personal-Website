Quick WIP notes

 Billionaires Row by Katherine Clarke, which briefly mentions offering plans for NYC Condos and CO-op. I think was also mentioned in the Risk Game: Self Portrait of an Entrepreneur by Francis J Greenburger.

 I then found Chris Wong's blog post—Adventures in FOIL: New York Condominium Offering Plans from 2015, and the NY AG's Offering Plan Database.

In Wong's blog post in 2015, he mentioned that brokers often didn't make offering plans available until after submitted an offer. While FOILable, they would provide a written copy for you to read in a office, not send a ditgal copy. 

At some, point the [NY AG's Offering Plan Database](https://offeringplandatasearch.ag.ny.gov/REF/welcome.jsp) was created. 

> In addition, we have now posted offering plans and amendments to the database for some plan IDs. If the offering plan or amendments associated with a particular plan ID have been posted to the database, they will appear on a “documents” tab (to the right of the “stat card” tab), where they can be downloaded. If no documents are available, the “documents” tab will not appear.  Additional documents will be posted on an ongoing basis as they are prepared for posting. If the documents you are seeking have not yet been posted to the database, you may request copies of offering plans or amendments pursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law (FOIL).
[Offering Plan Database](https://ag.ny.gov/libraries-documents/offering-plan-database)

NY AG says db has 35,995 rows. 

[titlevest](https://www.titlevest.com/public/HTML/offering-plan.html) has a private service 


> Over 6000 offering plans and growing, TitleVest's Coop/Condo Offering Plan Library is by far the fastest and most convenient way to obtain and review condo and coop offering plans.

> Web-based access to over 6000 offering plans. Digital offering plans are free. Printed copies are available for $200. TitleVest will contribute $50 toward the purchase of any offering plan we don't have in our library, provided TitleVest is allowed to make and retain ownership of a digital copy of the plan for our library. TitleVest will contribute $50 based on coordinating the purchasing of the offering plan. REBNY members will receive a contribution of $100.00 towards the purchasing of the offering plan.

Let's focus on 432 Park Avenue built by Harry B. Macklowe on Billionaires' Row:

- In there locked down PDF viewer


### FOIL NY AG

> About Offering Plan & Amendments:
> An offering plan is not complete without all of its amendments. If you want to see the current version of the offering plan, you should request the offering plan and all accepted amendments.
> Offering plans can be identified by plan IDs beginning with C, CC, CD, CR, H, L, NY, and T.
> Offering plans have NOT been filed for plan IDs beginning with CP, HO, and NA.
> See the Cooperative Policy Statement & No-Action Letter Applications request form for more information about records associated with a CP, HO, or NA plan ID.
