**Editorâ€™s Note: I initially intended Snippets to be for posts which were never updated, like blog posts. I don't know if I'll update this post if I find another large free image repository.** 

**A [public digital garden](https://github.com/RamVasuthevan/Personal-Website/pull/307) will be the correct spot for a post like this. Maybe this can be a spot for pages to be initially planted and then if they are repeatedly updated, they can he transplanted somewhere else.**
