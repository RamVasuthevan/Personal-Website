As of 2024-02-08, the [Wikipedia page for Interchange (de Kooning)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interchange_(de_Kooning)&oldid=1189302823) stated:

> Private collection of Kenneth C. Griffin. Currently loaned to and displayed at the Art Institute of Chicago

But the Art Institute of Chicago's [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240210102154/https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Willem%20de%20Kooning) does not contain Interchange.

I emailed the AIC asking if Interchange still loaned to the Art Institute of Chicago, on 2024-02-09 they replied stating that the it was not.

After, doing all of this, I realized Interchange on longer being on display is mentioned in [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/12/mega-billionaire-ken-griffin-has-moved-his-masterpieces-to-the-beach).
