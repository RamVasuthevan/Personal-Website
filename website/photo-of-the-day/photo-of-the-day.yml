  notes: Taken through the window of a Piedmont Airlines Embraer ERJ145. According to the GPS Position and GPS Altitude Exif data, the photo was taken just outside of Toronto Pearson at 132.8 meters above sea level, which is not possible since Pearson is at 174.46 m above sea level. I am not sure if the streaks are caused by the window, the sun or the camera. There are a lot of beautiful views which can only be seen through a window. I want to get better at taking photos through windows

  notes: Taken in the forest at Camp Ramblewood. I really like the bench in the middle of the forest. Seems like a perfect place to sit and think. Unfortunately, I was short on time, and the bench was a bit wet so I only had time to take a photo

  notes: I was really captivated by the poster, which said, "Are you feelin' faggy"? I tried to shoot a photo with the poster in the foreground and Queen St in the background. I think the concept is good, but I think that the execution could be better

  notes: I went out to take photos later in the night. There were many beautiful cityscapes, but many of the photos taken through the default camera app on my Google Pixel 6a came out grainy. But this photo of the foundation at Commerce Court came out great. When I worked at Commerce Court for about a year, I had a view of this foundation from my desk

  notes: Low-angle shot with the [Toronto Financial District BIA](https://www.torontofinancialdistrict.com/) sign taken from Bay and Adelaide. The background is a bit grainy, I want to get better at taking these nighttime cityscape shots. I really like low-angle shots which show the scale of buildings
