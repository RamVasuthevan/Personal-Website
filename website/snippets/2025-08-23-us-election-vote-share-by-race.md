Racial polarization in the US presidential election vote share has decreased since 2016.

Democrats have lost voter share among Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters between the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections, but gained voter share among White voters.

Conversely, Trump has gained voter share among Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters between the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections.
