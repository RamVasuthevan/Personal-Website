This page is a work in progress. I love food, but I'm not good at cooking. I want to fix that. 

This website is a hub for many of my projects, so it would be a natural home for my food related projects. But my food-related additions to this website have lived in feature-branch purgatory for a long time ([2023-11-12](https://github.com/RamVasuthevan/Personal-Website/pull/247) and [2024-03-20](https://github.com/RamVasuthevan/Personal-Website/pull/310)). I'm not sure what this page is going to evolve into or how much of it will remain on this page or even this website. 

But lets just get started.

## Grocery List

When I buy something, I want to know what I am getting. So if I find something that I like, I will buy the same thing over and over again. Maybe I should be trying new things more often.
