Some people like to birdwatch. I like to police spot. How police departments are organized says something interesting about the society that they serve

### [Toronto Community Housing Community Safety Unit](https://www.torontohousing.ca/current-tenants/tenant-safety/community-safety-unit)

- They were in an SUV
- Their car said special constable 
- I didn't know that Toronto Community Housing has their own police, I was kinda surprised

- I saw two of these on foot at Queen park.
- Their uniforms have bright stripe down their pants
- I didn't know that this department existed, but I'm not surprised since the Parliamentary Protective Service exists
