P.S. Why is this website so sparse?

I spent several years procrastinating on creating a personal website. Trying to create a good personal website using good tools with good content.

I was inspired by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/RamVasuthevan/status/1589036193966329856?s=20&t=ugmG3OLXRUIKGov6VA4zEQ) to actually just do it. Weâ€™ll see what improvements I make going forward.

Here is the [repo](https://github.com/RamVasuthevan/Personal-Website) for this website.
