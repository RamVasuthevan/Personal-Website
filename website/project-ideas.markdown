# Win a Stock Picking Contest

- Construct a portfolio from an available pool of securities to maximize the chances of winning a stock-picking contest.
- What if:
    - You can see your competitor's portfolio (but they can't see yours)?
    - There is trading during the duration of the contest?
    - Trading has transaction costs?
    - Your competitors can see your trades? Is there a dominant strategy? If so, what is it?

> Stock-picking contest with no options. I could see competitor's picks. Most competitors picked FAANG stocks. I picked [FNGU](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FNGU:NYSEARCA?hl=en), a 3x leveraged FAANG ETN. If FAANG stocks go up, then I win. If it doesn't, I lose, but it's fake money.
