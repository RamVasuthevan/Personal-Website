# Win a Stock Picking Contest

- Construct a portfolio from an available pool of securities to maximize the chances of winning a stock-picking contest.
- What if:
    - You can see your competitor's portfolio (but they can't see yours)?
    - There is trading during the duration of the contest?
    - Trading has transaction costs?
    - Your competitors can see your portfolio and trades? Is there a dominant strategy? If so, what is it?

> Stock-picking contest with no options. I could see competitor's picks. Most competitors picked FAANG stocks. I picked [FNGU](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FNGU:NYSEARCA?hl=en), a 3x leveraged FAANG ETN. If FAANG stocks go up, then I win. If it doesn't, I lose, but it's fake money.

# Generate a String Which Matches a Regex

- Given a regex, can you:
    - Return a string which matches?
    - Return a string which matches, uniformly selecting from all possible strings? Some regexes match infinite strings, what constraints need to be added to make this practical?

#  Toronto anthem of 1886?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Toronto anthem of 1886 was a real banger <a href="https://t.co/zG8V9VNF4N">pic.twitter.com/zG8V9VNF4N</a></p>&mdash; Doug Saunders (@DougSaunders) <a href="https://twitter.com/DougSaunders/status/1690021191912710144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- The screenshot looks like it was taken from [Toronto "called Back," from 1888 to 1847, and the Queen's Jubilee](https://books.google.ca/books?id=-R4WAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=fair+toronto+queen+city+of+the+west+of+thy+sister+cities+thou+art+the+best&source=bl&ots=LKcMmbd4KB&sig=ACfU3U3tcUYg0Zuu84m_hxTw7Cu1OxteTQ&hl=en&sa=X#v=onepage&q&f=false) on page 238
- It is a sonnet by John Imrie called Toronto from [Songs and Miscellaneous Poems](https://archive.org/details/songsmiscellaneo00imri/page/338/mode/2up?view=theater) on pg 338. (I'm not sure if this is the original source)
- A live preformance or the poem set to music would be cool
