Whether youâ€™re arriving or departing, getting to either at Pearson or Billy Bishop, it's much easier if public transit is running.

For Pearson, I take the subway to Union Station and then take the UP Express. For Billy Bishop, I take the subway to Union Station and then take the street car.

The Subway runs from 0600 to 0130 weekday and Saturday, and from 0800 to 0130 Sunday on Sunday [^1]

The UP Express runs from 0455 to 1257. [^2]
