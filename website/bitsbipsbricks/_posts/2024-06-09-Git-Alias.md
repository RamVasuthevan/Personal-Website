I have always had the temperament of a satifiser, I find something which works for me and I stick to it forever. I simple and esay, once I make a commitent to something I don't have think about that catgorty for teh rets of my life. I do this for bagels, pens and IDEs. But I am starting to wonder if I am missing out by not maximinering more.

I have deceined to customization my personal computing experince to match my needs and way I workf. I am an engiiner by trade. I can write one off software just for myself, to persfectly matcth the way that I wokr. I can extend, maintane and fix it as need. 

I am willing to put in the effort to need to reap the benfits to peresonal compuering envoment tailored to me. Now this is often an failire mode of enegiiner building cutsom diffcault to maintince (vim key binds) setup that will only be used by them. On the other, I respect those peiple and  seem to pretty good at being egijnners.

The easist way to build software people will use it to build softeware for youself. Now I usnderstand the perfeence for software are diffrent from otehr people (See PATIO11 TWEET abotu deignen)

It the spirt, TIL I learn about Git lasises

I have a to do list stored in a markdown file in a Jeykll websute in a pribvate gitub repo which I edit mostlung from my MacOS personal compuster with Cursot(A VScode based editor). Everyday I append my todo items to the end of the file and when I do them I cross them off. I send teh todlist and items' which I have done to my uncle for What's app. This is much better to do system then Tolist. There is accouablty as a I send teh todo list to me uncle and until in Todolsisy I need to be intional abotu what I choos eto add to my tolist for that day and what I choose to roll over


While most the edits to this priavet Jeykll site do through a PR. It is helpful even when I working byslef to have brnahc and system for revewing my old work. Something that oen of my old boss, intyrduted my to was Done-Done. What actailly needs to be done for a task to actally be done. (expand on done-doen)


But change to the tolist which are just new items appended to the bottom are just add to file in the main branch and can be force pushed without commit message. 

This is something normally takes mulple command 


git add website/to-do.markdown
git commit --allow-empty-message -m ''
git push origin main --force

I have added git alisses sync-to-do = "!f() { git add website/to-do.markdown && git commit --allow-empty-message -m \"\" && git push origin HEAD --force; }; f"


I have added this git alies to me repo's gitcongig. I edit my todo from my MacOS, but sometimes I edit the private jeyll site from github codespace so evebtally I would like to sync my alises around local copys but for now I will just stick to this.
