I want this to work which I am proud of ten years for now, I study of the flags used by the City of Toronto (1998-), Metropolitan Toronto (1953-1998) and the constituent municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto.

> The existing flag, designed by art advisory committee chairman Professor Eric Arthur and his son Paul, featured the city crest on a white and blue background. The art advisory committee recommended Council adopt the flag as the official city banner. But Mayor William Dennison disagreed, saying, “It’s not really a flag at all. It’s just another good way of displaying the city’s coat of arms.”

> A second competition was launched in 1997 to find a flag for the new City of Toronto. The public was invited to submit designs for a new flag but had to follow more specific criteria such as limiting designs to three colours and proportions 3′ x 6′. ... Council did not approve any of the 161 design submissions received from the public so asked City design staff to submit proposals.

> At a council meeting in November 1999, after months of heated debate, Deputy Mayor Case Ootes decided to let the public have a say in the flag design they preferred. Deputy Mayor Ootes, who was chairing the meeting, polled the audience in the Council Chambers as to what design they liked best – the slightly modified original flag designed by Renato De Santis or another design recommended by Councillor Brad Duguid. The flag used by the former City of Toronto flag evoked cheers and whistles from the audience, clearly the favourite.

- Flag of Toronto(1998-) adopted November 1999. 1:2 proportion

> By the end of the 1970s, Metropolitan Toronto, along with its six lower-tier municipalities, had adopted regional or municipal flags to represent their respective jurisdictions. East York was the last municipality in Metropolitan Toronto to adopt a municipal flag, having adopted a design in 1978 after holding a flag design contest
