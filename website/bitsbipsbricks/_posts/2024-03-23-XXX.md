I started writing a blog in the spirit of [Visa's do 100's things](). I first started writing on [Ghost](). I decided to merge it with a personal site here. I was upset that I couldn't have working footnotes if I had an image in the middle of the posts because the text above and below the image was a separate markdown block. I also gained confidence as a writer and felt comfortable with my name being associated with my writing. Moving to Jeykll was the right move. I can control how the blog looks and use GitHub for version control for my blog. If I migrate away from Jekyll or even GitHub, it'll be much easier. I don't know if Ghost will be here ten years from now, but I bet git will be, and I want writing to be still accessible.

Sometimes, I want to write something small [snippet], a note mostly for myself, that's not big enough for my [BitsBitsBricks] blogs.  There are several plugins that help with sub blogs. But I wasn't confident that they would be maintained and don't want to take on dependencies

I built [XXX]() so that you can have sub blogs using Jekyll collections or tags and Liquid without any plugins and Ruby code.

A [category](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#categories)  can be defined using  the front matter using keys `category` or `categories` (a space separated list of categories) or putting a directory above the post's `_post` directory


A tags is ...

This snippet is build to match the style of Minma, but similar logic can be used for another theme. Download the file and save it in _includes/blog.html. Invoke on a page that you want a blog feed, using the snippets belwo:

If you want a sub blog with one category:
{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% include blog.html category="category_name" %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% include blog.html tag="tag_name" %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Copy the following code and paste it in _includes/blog.html:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
ADD blog.html Here
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/pull/137/files#r124796175) assumes that if there are no posts then the feed won't be shown. I disagree. You can have a blog without blog posts.
