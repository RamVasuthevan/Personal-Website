In the sprirt of Visa's do 100's things I started a writing a blog. When I first started I starting writing it at a Ghost site, but I ddecied to merge it with a perosnl site here. I was unhappy that I couldn't by default have working footnoote if I had an image in the middle of the posts , because the text above and below the image was a seperate markdown block. Moving to jeykll was the right move, I can control more about how the blog looks like and get to take advange of Github as a VSC for my blog.

There are sometimes I want to write something small but doesn't deserve post on at bitsbipsbricks. I want a wanted sub blogs on my Jyekll site. There are several plugins that help you do that. But I wasn't condefent that they would be mainatined and don't want to take on a depeicnies/

This snippet is build to match the style of Minma, but similar logic can be used for anyother theme. Download the file and save it in _includes/blog.html. Invoke om a page that you want a blog feed, using:

{% include blog.html category="bitsbipsbricks" %}

if you want feed for one category or:

{% include blog.html categories="bitsbipsbricks snippets" %}

if you want feed for mutlple catagories


Minima assumes that if there are no posts then post-list-heading , post-list and rss-subscribe should not be shown (https://github.com/jekyll/minima/pull/137/files#r124796175). I disagree. You can have a blog without blog posts

With jekyll-feed, you can generate a feed for a category, but you can't generate a feed for multiple categories. I need to submit a PR to jekyll-feed. If the sub-blog is based on multiple categories, then it hides the RSS feed option


Keen observers will notice that o(n^2) operations ....
