In the sprirt of Visa's do 100's things I started a writing a blog. When I first started I starting writing it at a Ghost site, but I ddecied to merge it with a perosnl site here. I was unhappy that I couldn't by default have working footnoote if I had an image in the middle of the posts , because the text above and below the image was a seperate markdown block. Moving to jeykll was the right move, I can control more about how the blog looks like and get to take advange of Github as a VSC for my blog.

There are sometimes I want to write something small but doesn't deserve post on at bitsbipsbricks. I want a wanted sub blogs on my Jyekll site. There are several plugins that help you do that. But I wasn't condefent that they would be mainatined and don't want to take on a depeicnies/

Using collectiosns and Luqid you can create a subblogs without any plugins and code.

Add a [category](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#categories) to all of you blog posts. A category can be set by setting category in the frontmatter or setting a space seperated list as categories in the frontmatter or by putting a folder on top of your _posts folder

This snippet is build to match the style of Minma, but similar logic can be used for anyother theme. Download the file and save it in _includes/blog.html. Invoke om a page that you want a blog feed, using the snippets belwo:

If you want a sub blog with one category:
{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% include blog.html category="category_name1" %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want a sub blog mutlple catagories:
{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% include blog.html categories="category_name1 category_name2" %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


Copy the following code and paste it in _includes/blog.html:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
ADD blog.html Here
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/pull/137/files#r124796175) assumes that if there are no posts then the feed won't be shown. I disagree. You can have a blog without blog posts.

With jekyll-feed, you can generate a feed for a category, but you can't generate a feed for multiple categories. If the sub-blog is based on multiple categories, then it hides the RSS feed option.

Keen observers will notice that o(n^2) operations ....
