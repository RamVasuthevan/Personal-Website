I recently realized that acquiring technical skills, signaling technical skills to non-technical people, and signaling technical skills to those with technical skills are three diffrent things.

Quality of visual design is an important signal of technical competence. 

While most of my experience of backend related, I need to add front-end to my reporteur

I've tried to learn react before the whole thing seems so unnecessarily complicated. It seems diffcult to jump to the end 20 years of the stack evouldation withother understanding why descions were made. 

I think data modeling and usefully displaying data will remain a valuable skill regardless of how AI evolves.

With that in mind, I built this little mini-site: [Ontario Provincial Owned Heritage Properties](https://ontario-provincial-owned-heritage-properties.ramvasuthevan.ca).

I like architecture, two pages, [index.html](https://github.com/RamVasuthevan/ontario-provincial-owned-heritage-properties/blob/main/src/website/index.html) and [property.html](https://github.com/RamVasuthevan/ontario-provincial-owned-heritage-properties/blob/main/src/website/property.html) which are populated with from a [json](https://github.com/RamVasuthevan/ontario-provincial-owned-heritage-properties/blob/main/output/overview.json) file use vanilla js to populate the HTML documents. The static site to depoloyed to Cloudflare Pages.

The [offical version of site](https://www.pastport.mtc.gov.on.ca/OHPWeb/ohp/ohpSearch.xhtml) extensively use AJAX, so the side is diffcult to scrape the it's content does not show up in search results.

But I don't actually like this site, the data is very unclean. I don't have enough intrest or think that this is important enoufht for me to manaully clean the data
