I have always had the temperament of a satisficer. I find something that works for me, and I stick to it forever. It's simple and easy, once I make a commitment to something, I don't have to think about that category of thing again. I do this for [bagels](https://streams.place/ramvasuthevan/drops/203230380562751488), [pens](/ram-warrants#black-uni-ball-signo-um-151-gel-ink-pen---038-mm) and IDEs. But I am starting to wonder if I am missing out by not maximizing more.

When thinking about new solutions, whether it be software tools, hot sauces, or notetaking apps, I become a perfectionist. I start thinking of my elaborate theoretical use cases and then become overwhelmed and actually do nothing. 

If it's a cheap, [reversible decision](https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/), the only real mistake is procrastinating on making a decision

TLDR: JUST DO IT!
