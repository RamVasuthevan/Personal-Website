I have been trying to find the name for this very common notation for analogies:

A:B::C:D to represent A is to B as C is to D.

I have found it helpful to query LLMs (ChatGPT 4o in my case) with questions in the format A:B::C:?? 

I have tried to find the name for this notation by asking [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/671d1380-56b8-8013-84c4-7f1ace68b6db), using Google Search and Google Scholar, but I have not found anything authoritative.

I would love to know if there is a name for this notation and the history behind it. But it is hard to search for something when you don't know its name.

So I have written the article I would like to have found, for the next searcher.

This [sub-blog](/bitsbipsbricks/Jekyll-Sub-Blogs) is for contemporaneous posts, but I will update this if I learn more.

If you know more, please email me (my email is in the footer) or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RamVasuthevan).
