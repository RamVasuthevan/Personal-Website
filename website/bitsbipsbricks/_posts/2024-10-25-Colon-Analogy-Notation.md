I have been trying to find the name for this very common notation for analogies:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #111;">A:B::C:D</strong> to represent <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #111;">A is to B as C is to D</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>

I have found it helpful to query LLMs (ChatGPT 4o in my case) with questions in the format **A:B::C:??** 

I have tried to find the name for this notation by asking [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/671d1380-56b8-8013-84c4-7f1ace68b6db), using Google Search and Google Scholar, but I have not found anything authoritative.

I think the name **Colon Analogy Notation** is a good [Schelling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling_point). Someone familiar with the syntax would intuitively recognize the connection upon hearing the name. Likewise, if someone knows the syntax, this might be the name they would naturally search for.

I would love to know if there is a preexisting name for this notation and the history of its use. But it is hard to search for something when you don't know its name.

So I have written the article I would like to have found for the next searcher.
