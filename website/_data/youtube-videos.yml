  why: "Takes the interesting perspective that Cato was not a defender of the republic but was (even more corrupt than his peers) a corrupt and oligarchic force. He prevented the passage of popular and needed reforms that could've saved the republic. The filibuster was a novel political innovation, which would only be needed if the legislation was popular in the Senate and not even one tribute of the plebs could be convinced to veto the legislation"
