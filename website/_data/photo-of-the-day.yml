  notes: Taken through the window of a Piedmont Airlines Embraer ERJ145. According to the `GPS Position` and `GPS Altitude` Exif data the photo was taken just outside of Toronto Peason at 132.8 meters above sealevel, which is not possible since Pearson is at [174.46 m above sea level](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-99-123/FullText.html#:~:text=174.46%20m%20above%20sea%20level). I am not sure if the steaks are caused by window, the sun or the camera. There are a lot of beautiful views which can only be seen there windows. I want to get better at taking photos through windows

  notes: Taken a forest at Camp Ramblewood. I really like the bench of a forest. Seems like a perfect place to sit and think. Unfortunately, I was short on time, and the bench was a bit wet so I only had time to take a photo
