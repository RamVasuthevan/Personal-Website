# Building perpetual websites
- The web is an evolving standard. A website that works today can break tomorrow because a browser vendor decides not to honour a standard.
- How do you build websites that last forever? Not years, but decades.
- It’s sad to see projects in which people put blood, sweat and tears (okay, probably not blood) no longer work. It’s sad to see linkrot slowly,deteriorate away the web.
- Initial Ideas:
    - Static site generators
    - HTML/CSS only websites
    - Store in a public repo and host on Github Pages
    - Save all links to the the Internet Archive
    - 10 year domain registration

# Paradigms for one-person software projects
- For example, if a 1000 people are working on a project, breaking that project up into microservices and multiple repos could make coordination easier. But if only one person is working on the project, that might add unnecessary complexity.
- How should a project be structured differently if the project manager, designer, marketer and engineer are the same person?

# Make data more useful
- There is a lot of data, explicitly and implicitly, available.
- How can this data become more useful?

# Startup of you
- There is advice for startups, advice for managing stock portfolios and advice for careers
- There isn’t much personal finance advice that acknowledges that most people’s largest asset is human capital.
