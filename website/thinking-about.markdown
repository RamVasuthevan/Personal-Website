# Building perpetual websites
- The web is an evolving standard. A website that works today can break tomorrow because a browser vendor decides not to honour a standard.
- How do you build websites that last forever? Not years, but decades.
- It’s sad to see projects in which people put blood, sweat and tears (okay, probably not blood) break. It’s sad to see linkrot slowly, deteriorate away the web.
- Initial Ideas:
    - Static site generators
    - HTML/CSS only websites
    - Store in a public repo and host on Github Pages
    - Save all links to the Internet Archive
    - 10 year domain registration

# Paradigms for one-person software projects
- For example, if a 1000 people are working on a project, breaking that project up into microservices and multiple repos could reduce the amount of coordination needed. But if only one person is working on the project, that might add unnecessary complexity.
- How should a project be structured differently if the project manager, designer, marketer and engineer are the same person?

# Startup of you
- There's advice for portfolio management and career management
- There isn’t much personal finance advice that acknowledges that most people’s largest asset is human capital.

# Get more from data
- There are massive amounts of data which is being explicitly and implicitly created.
- It is being constantly pumped out into the void, being forgotten, lost and overwritten.
- It’s sitting there waiting to be parsed, structured, cleaned, searched and visualized. To be made useful.
- We have created great tools for sharing open-source code (Git, Github, PyPI, etc.), but how do we share open data?
- We have created easy-to-use tools for sharing documents (WordPress, Jekyll, Cloudflare Pages, etc.), but what about indexing, searching and visualizing data?

# Interesting Land Tenure, Zoning and Municipal Governance
- Across Canada and the United States there's a lot of uniformality in the relationship between municipal governments, land and its uses but there are some interesting anomalies:
    - UBC University Endowment Lands
    - Reedy Creek Improvement District
    - Universal City
    - City of Industry
    - The Villages
    - Loudoun County
    - Mobile City (Texas)
    - Houston
    - Sen̓áḵw
    - (The canceled) Sidewalk Toronto
    - Leasehold condominiums in Vancouver
    - Public Facility Corporations in Texas
    - Towns associated with religious groups (Ave Maria, Florida, Antelope, Oregon, Kiryas Joel, New York)
    - Ward’s Island and Algonquin Island in Toronto
