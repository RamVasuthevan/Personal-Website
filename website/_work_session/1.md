title: Starting to build ckan-to-sqlite
---

My first work session!! Starting to build ckan-to-sqlite. I am really happy that I did this. I felt much more productive with the recording and talking to myself.

I need to talk more and more explain clearly what I am doing. Can't even imagine how hard being a streamer must be.

I was hoping to use Sublime and not VSCode but my Sublime setup is not currently a workable coding environment.

I think next I should prepared more:

- Looking at all of the end point before I start coding
- Thought about the architecture of the code
- Read the docs for CKAN
