publishable: false
publishable_reason: Showed home address on Hover Console and WhatsApp Messages"

- Due to unexpectedly high Vercel hosting fees, this website is temporarily down.
- I got serveritis ([DHH Is Right About Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTa2d3OLXhg))

Goals:
- Just for this project
- Build db in GH Actions
- Deploy to DO Droplet

Notes:
- I need to block out my home address from hover and what's app message 
    - The video is 2:45, looking through the video remove personal information is going to be a pain in the ass
    - And I need to think about to edit videos
    - I think I'll add a boolean frontmatter key `publishable`
