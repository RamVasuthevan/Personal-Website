### 2024-02-16 Zevia Ginger Root Beer
- 4/10
- Bought from Longos
- It's okay, but I wouldn't have it again
- It lacks the sharp (bitter?) aftertaste of better ginger soda
- The sweetness tastes a little weird
    - (It's naturally favour, zero sugar)

### 2024-03-18 Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Beer
- 5/4
- Bought from [Victory Cafe](https://www.victorycafe.ca/) <!-- 440 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1X -->
- No sharpness
- Okay flavour
- Would be disappointed if I wanted ginger beer and I got this, but might have it again
