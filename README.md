Created a simple personal website.
Inspired using by [Tweet](https://twitter.com/everestpipkin/status/1588636275942502400?s=20&t=ugmG3OLXRUIKGov6VA4zEQ).

- Developing using Github Codespaces

Everything required to build site should be in this repo

No db. Manually editing files. Deploying the website using Cloudflare Pages.
