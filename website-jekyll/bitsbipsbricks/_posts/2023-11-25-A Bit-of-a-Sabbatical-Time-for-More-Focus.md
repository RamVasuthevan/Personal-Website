**Editor's Note: This was written in early November and my views have changed a bit, but I've decided to post this now for posterity**

The last 12 weeks have been great. It helped me figure out what to do with my life:

_I am a software engineer on sabbatical. I am working on applying technology to real estate in Toronto._

But my sabbatical is constrained by money and and thus constrained by time. It's now time for focus.

Projects which will be focusing on:

1. Lobbying in Toronto
    - Build a great way to search and visualize data published by the [City of Toronto's Lobbyist Registrar](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/accountability-officers/lobbyist-registrar/search-the-registry-register-as-a-lobbyist/search-the-lobbyist-registry/)
2. TRREB MLS Search Engine
    - Build a [Virtual Office Website
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Office_Website) for TRREB's MLS to make it easier for Realtor and their clients to search for properties in Toronto
3. Open Map of Toronto 
    - Combine open data sources to create a better view of Toronto. Definitely [Property Boundaries](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/property-boundaries/) and [Address Points (Municipal) - Toronto One Address Repository
](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/address-points-municipal-toronto-one-address-repository/), plus some more data from the [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/) and other data sources
4. Bits, Bips and Bricks
    - Write more regularly and about more topics 
    - The vibe that I am going for:
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really like this. It&#39;s helpful in getting over the little voice in my head that says &quot;It&#39;s not as good as the writers you admire&quot; <a href="https://t.co/h0HzKUrQSm">https://t.co/h0HzKUrQSm</a></p>&mdash; Ram Vasuthevan (in SF Oct 31 - Nov 7) (@RamVasuthevan) <a href="https://twitter.com/RamVasuthevan/status/1684079350050881536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I will also work on side projects, especially if they align with my goal of applying technology to real estate but it is now time to impose a discipline on myself.
